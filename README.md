# Surface View Based Game
Years ago while i was playing with surface view i got an idea to build a simple game using surface view.
At the time i was new to Android.

### Concept
It is based on surface View and it uses basic game mechanics like  
`Game Loop Thread`  
`sprites`  
`Collisions of Rectangles.`

### Gameplay
There are two types of aircrafts.  
**Human**  
**Code Controlled**  
  
Our(Human) f22 can be moved across screen  via Finger.
it will fire bullets at incoming enemy units.
Enemy units will appear on Game Plane based on simple algorithm
which is current number of active enemy planes.
